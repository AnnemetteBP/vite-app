          <h2>Why the bother?</h2>
          <p>There is a very good reason why we fly around on edible objects. This action helps us to obtain a trance like state. When enough Space Cats accomplishes this state simultainiously, they gain the power to hyponotize humanity. "The long term plan of our operation, is to train enough Space Cats to affect all humans and rule earth" - The Head of Space Cats says.</p>
